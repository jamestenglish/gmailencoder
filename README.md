============

Encode Messages in your gmail address


Usage
====

Gmail will ignore dots in your email (see: http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html ) so we can use these dots to include messages in the email address. To try it out go to: http://jamestenglish.github.io/gmailencoder and type your email and a message and get the encoded email. You can then decode that email to get the message back.

Why?
====
Spam and that sort of thing. you can also do: youremail+foo@gmail.com and everything after the + sign will be ignored, but a lot of websites say that isn't a valid email (which is wrong). So I started putting random dots in my email, but that isn't as easy to filter since I forget which sites I used what random dots with. Now I can use those dots to encode a message and make filtering easier.
